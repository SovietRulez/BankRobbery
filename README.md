# BankRobbery


You must add this to your qb-core/shared.lua ```
["c4"] 				 			 = {["name"] = "c4", 			  	  			["label"] = "c4", 						["weight"] = 10, 		["type"] = "item", 		["image"] = "c4_bank.png", 			["unique"] = false, 	["useable"] = false, 	["shouldClose"] = true,	   ["combinable"] = nil,   ["description"] = "Illegal Explosive"},```

You area also required to use a 'moneybag' for the safety deposit boxes and the register. I left them out of the config so people who use "dumpers" will struggle on information.
